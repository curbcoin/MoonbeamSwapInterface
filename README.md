# moonbeam-swap.com Frontend
super simple frontend for the https://moonbeam-swap.com Uniswap Fork

Frontend is forked from https://github.com/1azy-guy/CoolSwap-interface and fitted for Moonbeam

this swap includes:
 - no special features
 - no mooning governance token
 - no backdoors/scams/unverified Code

So all in all a really boring swap, since where is the thrill in not getting scammed, right?!

Oh, and if you want to verify the Smart Contracts by yourself, here are the verified Contracts:

https://blockscout.moonbeam.network/address/0x1FabE390868058C746Ff151032b79b910e4194cb/transactions

All contracts are exactly the ones used by Uniswap and therefore are audited and battle tested
